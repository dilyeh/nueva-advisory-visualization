# Advisory Visualization

We surveyed students at Nueva about their experience with advisory. This visualization shows the result of that survey. 

This visualization was inspired by the [The Stages of Relationships, Distributed](https://flowingdata.com/2019/03/26/relationship-stages/) visualization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The code is pretty bad. Don't look too much at it. 
(I don't actually care that much. Take a gander if you want. Just be prepared.)
